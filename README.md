This Python Snake Game is a classic arcade-style game implemented in Python using the turtle module to create a graphical user interface (GUI). Players can control the snake using keyboard inputs, navigating it through the game board to collect food and grow longer. The objective is to avoid colliding with walls or the snake's own body while aiming to achieve the highest score possible.

Features:
1) Graphical User Interface (GUI): The game features a user-friendly graphical interface created with the turtle module, providing an immersive gaming experience.
2) Keyboard Controls: Players can control the snake's movement using keyboard inputs (arrow keys), adding a dynamic and interactive element to the gameplay.
3) Scoring System: The game keeps track of the player's score based on the number of food items collected and the snake's length, encouraging players to strive for higher scores with each playthrough.
4) Game Over Conditions: The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or its own body, displaying the final score and allowing players to restart for another round of gameplay.
